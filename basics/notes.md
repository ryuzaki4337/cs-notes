- Computer understands either 0 or 1, which is 1 bit.

- byte is 8 bits.

- short is 16 bits.

- int is 32 bits. (Stores only integers)

- long is 64 bits. (Stores integers of higher value)

- Int variable cannot store a decimal value.

- Float can be used to store 6-7 decimal digits of precision and is 32 bits.

- Double can be used to store 15 decimal digits of precision and is 64 bits.

- A single +,- before a value doesn't increment or decrement the value. For example, int num1 = 6; int num2 = -num1; then the value of num2 is -6.

- ! symbol can be used any number of types before a value. For example, boolean fd1 = true; boolean fd2 = !!fd1; then the value of fd2 is true.

- Pre-increment (++x) --> Changes the value of x before hand. Similarly for pre-decrement.

- Post-increment (x++) --> Changes the value of x after an operation. Similarly for post-decrement.

- Ternary operator --> Condition ? First : Second.

- Strings are immutable i.e. when you try to change the value of a string, it changes the address of the initial string and creates a new object of the string.

- Implicit type conversions works when there is no data loss when converting. For example, from int to double.

- Explicit type conversions comes into picture when there is a data loss when converting. For example, from double to int.

- final keyword will be used when you don't want to change a value assigned to a variable.
