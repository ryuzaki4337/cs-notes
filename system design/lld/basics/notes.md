- High-Level Design (HLD) is like the architect's blueprint — it says where the rooms will be, how big they are, and how they're connected.

- Low-Level Design (LLD) is like deciding where the switches go, how the plumbing is laid out, what materials to use, etc.

- LLD is where your code starts to take shape. It's a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle that focuses on the detailed design of individual components or modules of a system.

- Key Characteristics of LLD:
    - Granular and Code-Level
    - Implementation-Focused
    - Applies OOP Principles

- Importance of Low Level Design:
    - Avoids Rework
    - Improves Collaboration
    - Promotes Scalability
    - Encourages Best Practices

- Software design principles are guidelines that help software developers create systems that are easy to understand, maintain, and extend. These principles can be applied at both the high-level and low-level design stages. Here are three cornerstone key software design principles:
    - DRY
    - KISS
    - YAGNI

- DRY — Don't Repeat Yourself
    - Avoid duplication of logic or code. Repeating code makes the system hard to maintain and error-prone. If a change is required, you might forget to update all occurrences.

    - Importance:
        - Reduces redundancy
        - Easier maintenance
        - Single point of change

- KISS — Keep It Simple, Stupid
    - Use the simplest possible solution that works. Avoid clever, convoluted code.

    - Importance:
        - Easier debugging
        - Improved readability
        - Better maintainability
        - Faster development

- YAGNI — You Aren't Gonna Need It
    - Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.

    - Importance:
        - Reduced waste
        - Simplified codebase
        - Faster development
